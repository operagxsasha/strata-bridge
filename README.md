## How To Run Locally

### Prerequisites

-   [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
-   [SP1 Toolchain](https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/getting-started/install) and associated [linkers](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/riscv-none-elf-gcc-xpack/releases/tag/v14.2.0-2).
    -   Install the SP1 toolchain: `curl -L https://sp1up.succinct.xyz | bash`
    -   After installation, run `sp1up` to complete the setup
-   Credentials to connect to SP1's [infra](https://explorer.succinct.xyz).
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
-   [`sqlx-cli`](https://lib.rs/crates/sqlx-cli) to run database migrations.
-   [`bitcoind`](https://bitcoin.org/en/download) to run the unit tests.
-   [`just`](https://just.systems/) to run the commands in this repository.

We also provide a [`flake.nix`](flake.nix) with a `devShell` with all the dependencies
necessary for local development.
Install [Nix](https://nixos.org) and run:

```sh
nix develop
```

### Running

Run the Strata stack (`strata-client`, `strata-reth`, `bitcoind`) as per the instructions
in the [`alpen`](https://github.com/alpenlabs/alpen/tree/bitvm2) repository.

Then, see the instructions in [`docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md) to run the bridge nodes
and their corresponding secret-service nodes.
